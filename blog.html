    <p>Why a basic site? I'm tired of not having my own. NetworkChuck inspired me in <a href='https://youtu.be/EXfFBEuCAr0?si=7vfKYcTDU7mxfmv7'>THIS VIDEO</a>, saying it only takes five seconds!</p>
    <p>Well, it took longer than that, but not more than about thirty minutes. I had to do minimal thinking about what I wanted to include.</p>
    <h2>So here it is. My site. My blog. My journey to becoming a web developer.</h2>
    <p>I've been learning code for the last two years. It's been full of ups and downs. I've built the basic bootcamp portfolio site, a Pokedex, and a couple of blogs. My Github is a mess of inclomplete projects that I'll eventually need to clean up; I can't even find the afore mentioned portfolio site.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until I was building my third blog that React started to click for me. I had the blog running as smooth as butter, and the code was clean. I felt like I actually knew what I was doing. Then, I couldn't get it deployed, and now it's been awhile since I've tried - life got busy and I took a break.</p>
    <h2>Well, no more excuses!</h2>
    <p>I have this site. I'm starting my own business and about to close out my first client. I still don't know what to charge! I'll be taking a Modern Web Development class this summer - to round out some knowledge gaps.</p>
    <p>I'm also starting this blog so I can share my struggles and successes. When I close out my first client I'll link their site on my main page to show it off.</p>
    <h3>More to come. Stay tuned!</h3>
    <p>The main site is currently under construction and will be built with MERN stack.</p>

    <h2>Profile Page and Class?</h2>
    <p>I'm excited to be finishing up my React profile page and can't wait to start Modern Web Development at Notre Dame. 'Discussions of engineering trade-offs will be complemented by projects in which students will develop their own web apps. These techniques are used by companies such as Groupon, Airbnb, Netflix, Medium and PayPal which have all adopted a full stack JavaScript approach, and are very useful to those interested in smaller tech startups as well.'</p>
