    <p>Why a basic site? I'm tired of not having my own. NetworkChuck inspired me in <a href='https://youtu.be/EXfFBEuCAr0?si=7vfKYcTDU7mxfmv7'>THIS VIDEO</a>, saying it only takes five seconds!</p>
    <p>Well, it took longer than that, but not more than about thirty minutes. I had to do minimal thinking about what I wanted to include.</p>
    <h2>So here it is. My site. My blog. My journey to becoming a web developer.</h2>
    <p>I've been learning code for the last two years. It's been full of ups and downs. I've built the basic bootcamp portfolio site, a Pokedex, and a couple of blogs. My Github is a mess of inclomplete projects that I'll eventually need to clean up; I can't even find the afore mentioned portfolio site.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until I was building my third blog that React started to click for me. I had the blog running as smooth as butter, and the code was clean. I felt like I actually knew what I was doing. Then, I couldn't get it deployed, and now it's been awhile since I've tried - life got busy and I took a break.</p>
    <h2>Well, no more excuses!</h2>
    <p>I have this site. I'm starting my own business and about to close out my first client. I still don't know what to charge! I'll be taking a Modern Web Development class this summer - to round out some knowledge gaps.</p>
    <p>I'm also starting this blog so I can share my struggles and successes. When I close out my first client I'll link their site on my main page to show it off.</p>
    <h3>More to come. Stay tuned!</h3>
    <p>The main site is currently under construction and will be built with in MERN stack.</p>
